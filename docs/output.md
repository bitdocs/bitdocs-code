# Output Bits

These are the bits that output something, whether it be a light, some type of signal, a sound, or something else.

These bits actually do the work, as with just [input](/placeholder) and [logic](/placeholder) bits, nothing will happen, so you need an output bit for your device to function.

## Buzzer

This bit creates a buzzing sound when recieving power. It's very simple as it can't be controlled too much and has a very simple use.

### How to Use

This bit is very simple, so simple it doesn't even need instructions. Simply connect the bit to a powered circuit, and the bit will start buzzing.

### Other Info

* You can use the [dimmer](/placeholder) or [slide dimmer](/placeholder) bits to control the volume of the buzz.

## LED

This bit will light up green when it recieves power. Like the buzzer, it also is very simple.

### How to Use

Connect the bit to a powered circuit, and the bit will light up.

### Other Info

* You can use the [dimmer](/placeholder) or [slide dimmer](/placeholder) bits to control the intensity of the LED's light.

## Long LED

This bit is almost exactly the same as the normal [LED](#led) bit, but has a few key differences.

Those differences are:

* Outputs a bluish-white light instead of a bright green one.
* As seen in the picture above, the LED is extended from the main electronic by a wire.
