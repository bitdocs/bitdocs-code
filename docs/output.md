# Output Bits

These are the bits that output something, whether it be a light, some type of signal, a sound, or something else.

These bits actually do the work, as with just [input](/placeholder) and [logic](/placeholder) bits, nothing will happen, so you need an output bit for your device to function.

All of these bits also pass electricity along, so connecting another bit to the end of an output will continue your device. This means you can have as many [buzzers](#buzzer), [speakers](/placeholder), and other noise making bits as you want! (Though we advise against this.)

## Buzzer

![Buzzer Bit](https://i.shgcdn.com/247e8613-ec06-4d14-9858-55bd44c88ebe/-/format/auto/-/preview/3000x3000/-/quality/lighter/)

This bit creates a buzzing sound when recieving power. It's very simple as it can't be controlled too much and has a very simple use.

### How to Use

This bit is very simple, so simple it doesn't even need instructions. Simply connect the bit to a powered circuit, and the bit will start buzzing.

### Other Info

* You can use the [dimmer](/placeholder) or [slide dimmer](/placeholder) bits to control the volume of the buzz.

## LED

This bit will light up green when it recieves power. Like the [buzzer](#buzzer), it also is very simple.

### How to Use

Connect the bit to a powered circuit, and the bit will light up.

### Other Info

* You can use the [dimmer](/placeholder) or [slide dimmer](/placeholder) bits to control the intensity of the LED type bits.
* The [light sensor](/placeholder) bit can be activated by any bit that produces light, including all LED type bits.

## Long LED

This bit is almost exactly the same as the normal [LED](#led) bit, but has a few key differences.

Those differences are:

* Outputs a bluish-white light instead of a bright green one.
* As seen in the picture above, the LED is extended from the main electronic by a wire.

## Bright LED

![Bright LED Bit](https://www.stemfinity.com/image/cache/data/LittleBits/littleBits-Bright-LED-Module-1-500x554.jpg)

The Bright LED is exactly the same as the normal [LED](#led) bit, but is much brighter and is colored white instead of green.

## UV LED

The UV LED is the same as the [long LED](#long-led) bit, though it emits UV light instead of normal, visible light.

## IR LED

![IR LED Bit](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1494/3290/products/O2ByM7FA_2048x.jpeg?v=1571439466)

The IR LED follows the same pattern as the [UV LED](#uv-led) and [long LED](#long-led) bits, but emits infrared (IR) light instead of UV or visible light.

### Other Info

* Because it emits IR light, it can be used to activate the [remote trigger](/placeholder) bit.

## RGB LED

![RGB LED Bit](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/f6/60/ce/f660ce55e9c352dfd180190fe5dd3870.jpg)

The RGB LED uses three dials (slides on some models) to control three values (red, green, and blue), to reach the entire spectrum of visible color.

### How to Use

As you can see in the picture, the RGB LED bit has three dials that can be turned with the purple littleBits screwdriver. Adjusting these dials will control the amount of red, green, and blue that the LED outputs.

Some newer models, like the one pictured on the [littleBits website](https://littlebits.com/products/rgb-led) have slides instead of screwdriver dials, which makes adjusting the values much easier. These newer models work no different than the original ones, and the way you control the values is the only thing that has changed.

## Vibration Motor

![Vibration Motor Bit](https://i.shgcdn.com/9a0f7dbb-b884-40a3-93c0-ab3685f9435d/-/format/auto/-/preview/3000x3000/-/quality/lighter/)

The vibration motor is very simple, just like most other output bits. When power is recieved, the metal disc connected to the main bit via the wire will begin to vibrate.

## Speaker

![Speaker Bit](https://i.shgcdn.com/81d28baf-e336-43f2-b7cb-9a0c3cee2165/-/format/auto/-/preview/3000x3000/-/quality/lighter/)

The speaker bit, also known as the synth speaker, produces sound when given an input from a sound producing bit

### How to Use

The speaker bit doesn't just produce sound when given power, it requires an [input](/placeholder) bit to know what sound to produce.

Instructions:

1. Connect a sound producing input bit to the power bit. (ex. [oscillator](/placeholder), [MP3 Player](/placeholder), [keyboard](/placeholder))
2. Connect the speaker to the input bit.
3. Tune the input bit and the speaker's volume as needed, then turn on the power and the synth speaker will start playing the tune.

## Fan

![Fan Bit](https://i.shgcdn.com/ef1a70fd-e06a-4fd2-b89b-babc0a3548d1/-/format/auto/-/preview/3000x3000/-/quality/lighter/)

When the fan bit recieves power, the fan connected to the bit will begin to spin.
