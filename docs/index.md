# Welcome!

Welcome to the documentation on the LittleBits electronics.
For students around us, the LittleBits can seem confusing, but we're here to show you that they're not.
To start, we recommend looking at our [examples](placeholder) page, though feel free to look around at your leisure.

Also, if you need any support, shoot us an email at <webmaster@bitdocs.ml>
