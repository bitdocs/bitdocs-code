# BitDocs

Welcome to BitDocs, a documentation on the littleBits electronics kits.

For students around us, the littleBits can seem confusing, but we're here to show you that they're not.

To start, we recommend looking at our [examples](placeholder) page where you can find some examples of simple circuits.

If you need any support, email us at at <webmaster@bitdocs.ml>.
