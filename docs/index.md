# BitDocs

Welcome to BitDocs, a documentation on the littleBits electronics kits.

For students around us, the littleBits can seem confusing, but we're here to show you that they're not.

To start, we recommend looking at this helpful [examples](https://inventtolearn.com/littlebitsall.pdf) page where you can find some examples of simple circuits.
