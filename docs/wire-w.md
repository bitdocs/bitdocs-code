# Wires

Wires are the middle pieces. They have varying functions and can do things in between [inputs](input) and [outputs](output).

**NOTE: The official name for bits with an orange color is WIRE**

It goes between two bits and provides an extension. It allows you to place bits farther apart from each other, turn corners, and make connections that can twist, turn, and spin. It's just a wire.

## Fork

It forks one input signal to three outputs. It can be used to send any type of signal.

## Split

Similar to the [fork bit](#fork), it splits one input to two outputs with an extension between each output. It can be used to send any type of signal.
