# Digital Logic

These bits perform various digital logic functions.

**NOTE: The official name for bits with an orange color is WIRE**

## AND (aka Double AND)
![AND bit](https://i.shgcdn.com/a39f2c15-fcb3-430c-b22a-b3ee61dd9c9f/-/format/auto/-/preview/3000x3000/-/quality/lighter/)

It outputs an ON signal only when input 1 AND input 2 are both receiving an ON signal.

## NAND
![NAND bit](https://i.shgcdn.com/5c06dd06-9a7e-47d2-b33a-457df6012ff2/-/format/auto/-/preview/3000x3000/-/quality/lighter/)

It is the opposite of an [AND gate](#AND), so it sends an OFF when both inputs are sending ON, and ON when an [AND gate](#AND) is normally sending an OFF.

## OR
![OR bit](https://i.shgcdn.com/3d6c8e96-5536-4b28-9327-5c6c7c931972/-/format/auto/-/preview/3000x3000/-/quality/lighter/)

It sends an ON if one or more of the inputs sends an ON.

## NOR
![NOR bit](https://i.shgcdn.com/a2c56447-f6d6-413d-9837-707983489d0a/-/format/auto/-/preview/3000x3000/-/quality/lighter/)

It sends an ON if and only if both inputs are sending OFF.

## XOR
![XOR bit](https://i.shgcdn.com/903bcc83-e704-4ddf-a487-4b160bc6364f/-/format/auto/-/preview/3000x3000/-/quality/lighter/)

It sends an ON if the number of ON inputs is odd.

## Inverter
![Inverter bit](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1494/3290/products/NpMJAgpg_1_2048x.jpeg?v=1571439466)

It sends out the opposite of whatever it receives. For example, if it receives an ON signal, it sends an OFF signal.

## Latch
![Latch bit](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1494/3290/products/jRupPEw_2048x.jpeg?v=1571439466)

It sends a constant output, like a switch, but when it receives a momentary input, like a button, it will switch its output. It is like a toggle.

### How to Use

Hook it up after a button, turning the button into a switch.

# Wires

Wires are the middle pieces. They have varying functions and can do things in between [inputs](input) and [outputs](output).

## Wire

![Wire bit](https://i.shgcdn.com/554412d0-35cd-4023-97a3-0081190f6281/-/format/auto/-/preview/3000x3000/-/quality/lighter/)

It goes between two bits and provides an extension. It allows you to place bits farther apart from each other, turn corners, and make connections that can twist, turn, and spin. It's just a wire.

## Fork
![Fork bit](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1494/3290/products/EggJpbNQ_2048x.jpeg?v=1571439466)

It forks one input signal to three outputs. It can be used to send any type of signal.

## Split
![Split bit](https://i.shgcdn.com/03f5794e-495c-4e62-b068-5ce87686911c/-/format/auto/-/preview/3000x3000/-/quality/lighter/)

Similar to the [fork bit](#fork), it splits one input to two outputs with an extension between each output. It can be used to send any type of signal.
