# Digital Logic

These bits perform various digital logic functions.

**NOTE: The official name for bits with an orange color is WIRE**

## AND (aka Double AND)
![AND bit](https://i.shgcdn.com/a39f2c15-fcb3-430c-b22a-b3ee61dd9c9f/-/format/auto/-/preview/3000x3000/-/quality/lighter/)

It outputs an ON signal only when input 1 AND input 2 are both receiving an ON signal.

## NAND
![NAND bit](https://i.shgcdn.com/5c06dd06-9a7e-47d2-b33a-457df6012ff2/-/format/auto/-/preview/3000x3000/-/quality/lighter/)

It is the opposite of an [AND gate](#AND), so it sends an OFF when both inputs are sending ON, and ON when an [AND gate](#AND) is normally sending an OFF.

## OR
![OR bit](https://i.shgcdn.com/3d6c8e96-5536-4b28-9327-5c6c7c931972/-/format/auto/-/preview/3000x3000/-/quality/lighter/)

It sends an ON if one or more of the inputs sends an ON.

## NOR
![NOR bit](https://i.shgcdn.com/a2c56447-f6d6-413d-9837-707983489d0a/-/format/auto/-/preview/3000x3000/-/quality/lighter/)

It sends an ON if and only if both inputs are sending OFF.

## XOR
![XOR bit](https://i.shgcdn.com/903bcc83-e704-4ddf-a487-4b160bc6364f/-/format/auto/-/preview/3000x3000/-/quality/lighter/)

It sends an ON if the number of ON inputs is odd.

## Inverter
![Inverter bit](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1494/3290/products/NpMJAgpg_1_2048x.jpeg?v=1571439466)

It sends out the opposite of whatever it receives. For example, if it receives an ON signal, it sends an OFF signal.

## Latch
![Latch bit](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1494/3290/products/jRupPEw_2048x.jpeg?v=1571439466)

It sends a constant output, like a switch, but when it receives a momentary input, like a button, it will switch its output. It is like a toggle.

### How to Use

Hook it up after a button, turning the button into a switch.
