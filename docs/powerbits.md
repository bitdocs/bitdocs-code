# Power Modules

These are modules that deliver power to all of the modules in your circuit.

You must have one power module for your circuit to function, as without one of these modules, power can not be delivered to the modules

## Power

This module is the most basic in this category, as it only requires one 9V Battery. This will be the most common, as the small battery makes your circuits very portable.

### How to use

To use the power module, you need two things, a [9V battery](placeholder) and a 9V battery [clip connector](placeholder).

Instructions:

1. Attach the clip connector to the battery
2. Plug the connector into the port on the module
3. Attach any other module to it.
4. Once your circuit is built, flip the black switch, which lets power out into the circuit

### Other Info

* Leave the power switch off while building your circuit, as it can cause unforseen circumstances.

## USB Power

This module is very similar to the normal [Power](#power) module, though instead of using a [9V battery](placeholder) and [clip converter](placeholder), it has a Micro-USB connection that is used to supply power.

### How to use

To use this module, you need a power source that has a USB output (computer, battery bank, etc.), and a Micro-USB cable (Old android charging cables would work well).

Instructions:

1. Use a Micro-USB cable to plug the bit into a computer, battery bank, or other device capable of transmitting power
2. Connect the bit to your circuit and watch power flow through it!

### Other Info

* There is no power switch on this bit, so keep it unplugged from the power source or the circuit until the circuit is complete
