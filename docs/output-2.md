# Output Bits (Page 2)

These are the bits that output something, whether it be a light, some type of signal, a sound, or something else.

These bits actually do the work, as with just [input](/placeholder) and [logic](/placeholder) bits, nothing will happen, so you need an output bit for your device to function.

All of these bits also pass electricity along, so connecting another bit to the end of an output will continue your device. This means you can have as many [buzzers](#buzzer), [speakers](/placeholder), and other noise making bits as you want! (Though we advise against this.)

## DC Motor

The DC motor is a simple motor that can be controlled to run either clockwise, counter-clockwise, or vary in speed and direction by the amount of power given.

### How to Use

The DC motor has three different settings, cw (clockwise), ccw (counter-clockwise), and var (variable). While the clockwise and counter-clockwise settings are self-explanitory, the variable setting can be a bit tricky. The variable setting is controlled via the amount of power going through. Try it out by using a [dimmer](/placeholder) or [slide dimmer](/placeholder) with this bit.

The [wheel](/placeholder) included with some kits can be attached to the motor to create an electric-powered wheel.

## Servo

The servo bit is similar to the [DC motor](#dc-motor) bit, though is much more specialized and controllable.

### How to Use

The servo bit has two different settings. the TURN mode adjusts the position of the servo based on the signal it's recieving. In simpler terms, when in TURN mode, the servo can be controlled via a [dimmer](/placeholder), [slide dimmer](/placeholder), or any other bit that controls the amount of power.

The SWING setting will have the servo move back and forth on its own. The speed of the servo in this mode can be slowed by lowering the power with a [dimmer](/placeholder).

## Number

![Number Bit](https://i.shgcdn.com/6fdac1e9-13ca-4869-b089-e70ae159ba33/-/format/auto/-/preview/3000x3000/-/quality/lighter/)

The number bit has two seven-segment number displays that display different numbers based on four different settings.

### How to Use

This bit has four different settings for counting. Those settings are up, down, voltage, and value. Up and down are in the couny category, while voltage and value are in the read category.

For the count category, both up and down count up and down respectively when they recieve a signal. This bit will **NOT** count up or down continuously if there is continuous power delivered, it will only occur when a new signal is recieved.
For example, attaching a [button](/placeholder) before this bit will increase the count every time the button is pressed, because the bit is recieving a new signal. If this sounds confusing, play with it a little bit, and you'll get it eventually.

For the read category, the bit will, no surprise, read the voltage and value of the current signal. If you attach this bit directly to the power on a read mode, it will read 5.0 on voltage mode, and 99 on value mode.
You can use a [dimmer](/placeholder) to control the voltage and value. Both scale similarly to each other. The voltage ranges from 0 (no power) to 5.0 (full power), and the value ranges from 0 (no power) to 99 (full power).
